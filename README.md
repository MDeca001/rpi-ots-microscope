OTS - Raspberry Pi Microscope with Off-The-Shelf parts

# Attention - experimental code
This is my first public github repo, I'll be working on it in my spare time with A LOT of help from Gemini and similar tools since I'm not that proficient in Python programming.
Feel free to fork, edit and suggest improvements!

# Introduction

This project aims to create a simple microscope using a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, a generic USB microscope from Aliexpress and a simple 7 inch HDMI display.
It's a relatively specific and niche use-case and my first public repo so i hope it can be useful to someone somewhere
